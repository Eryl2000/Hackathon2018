# Planet-Ball
## Gameplay
A fast-paced competitive arcade game played on a single computer where players knock a big ball into their opponent's goal. Players cannot directly control their own movement, however. Instead, they are tethered to pivots and can grapple to new pivots throughout the map, then time their release from the pivot to propel themselves forward. The first to score three balls in their opponent's goal wins!

Players also have two powerful cooldown abilites, Boost and Iron. Boost increases the player's speed for a short duration, while Iron increases the player's mass for a short duration. Good management of these abilites can allow players to skillfully block shots or quickly launch across the map to score a goal.
